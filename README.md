# sticky-notes

This is a fun personal organizational app inspired my use of post-it notes in real life. This site gives you a personal sitcky note board where you can post notes to various pages with different topics or unifying theme. Notes are draggable to create a dynamic feel similar to that of posting sticky notes around a space.

Link to project: coming soon.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React

In the early stages of design and structure. Currently building out styling and functional components.

Lessons Learned: The biggest lesson I have learned throughout this build so far is how to deal with components in react and how build functionality into them.
